# project-data
An experimental attempt to make a CLI for supply-chain modeling for Helpful Engineering's Project Data

# Installation

I'm not much of a pythonista. I've installed Anaconda to get the sympy package, and I assume any user of this will have to as well.

You also have to instal yamale:

> pip install yamale

Also, we use a submodule, you may have to execute:

> git submodule update
